You apply alchemical fluids or holy water to a contaminated humanoid creature while reciting an exacting magical chant that expels eldritch contaminants from the targetâ€™s body. When you finish casting the spell, all contamination levels and mutations are removed from the creature. It then gains one level of exhaustion for each contamination level removed with this spell.
