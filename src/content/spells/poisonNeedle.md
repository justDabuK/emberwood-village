You launch a conjured dart coated with lethal poison at a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 poison damage.

If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

This spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
