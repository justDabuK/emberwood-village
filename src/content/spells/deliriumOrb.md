_When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination._

You draw chaotic magical power from the delerium chip held in your hand, and blast a creature you can see within range with paradoxical power. Choose one ability score, then choose cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage. The target must succeed on a saving throw using the chosen ability score; it takes 6d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot
level above 1st.

**Available for**: sorcerer, warlock, wizard, apothecary
