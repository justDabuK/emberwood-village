*Rare Rapier (requires attunement)* 

This magic sword's blade is fashioned from a horn or spine from a delirium dragon and seems to constantly shift between possible forms.  

While attuning to the blade you feel the urge to give it a name. 

You can use a bonus action to speak its name, causing it to set its appareance for 1 minute. Roll a d6 to determine the effect
