Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to necrotic damage and cannot gain contamination levels. The affected creature may rest normally within the Haze. This spell ends immediately if the creature casts a contaminated spell.

**Available for**: bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, wizard, apothecary

**Researching the Spell**: A character who can cast 7th level  spells, knows the [Neutralizing Field](/spells/neutralizingField) spell, and who has visited the *Delirium Heart* can research contamination immunity.
