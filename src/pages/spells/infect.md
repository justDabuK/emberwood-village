You inflict a creature you can see within range with a magical disease. At the start of each of the targetâ€™s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 1d12 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one. If a target succeeds on three of these saves, the spell ends.

A _lesser restoration_ spell cast on the target ends this spell early.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for every two slot levels above 1st.
