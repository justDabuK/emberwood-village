A flock of floating spectral hands appear and grasp a target you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw. A target takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

In addition, on a failed saving throw the ghostly hands grapple the target until the end of your next turn, and immediately move the target up to 30 feet in a direction of your choice (but not upward). On its turn, the creature can use an action to attempt to escape the grapple by making a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, the grapple ends.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the grasping ghost can target one additional creature within range for each spell level above 2nd.
