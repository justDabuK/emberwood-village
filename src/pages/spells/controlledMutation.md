*When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.*

You weave contaminated energy to temporarily imbue a creature within range with a beneficial mutation. Choose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the spell ends.

**Strength**. The target has advantage on Strength attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, its melee weapon attacks deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage for the spell’s duration.

**Constitution**. The target has advantage on Constitution checks and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for the spell’s duration.

**Dexterity**. The target has advantage on Dexterity attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. The target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, its attacks with ranged and finesse weapons score a critical hit on an 18–20 for the spell’s duration.

**Intelligence**. The target has advantage on Intelligence ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. The target can also choose to gain a Contamination Level.  If it does, for the duration of this spell, while the target is concentrating on a spell it has cast, it’s concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.

**Wisdom**. The target has advantage on Wisdom ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. The target can also choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, it gains blindsight to a range of 60 feet and can’t be surprised while it is conscious.

**Charisma**. The target has advantage on Charisma ability checks and saving throws, as well as spell attack rolls. In addition, the target can choose to gain a Contamination Level. If it does, for the duration of this spell, when the target makes a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, it can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose one additional effect for every two slot levels above 2nd.
