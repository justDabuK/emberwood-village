*When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.*

You shatter the delerium fragment in your hand into three glowing comet-like motes of magical force which you hurl at your foes. Each comet hits a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A comet deals 2d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier force damage to its target and pushes it 10 feet away from you. The comets all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more comet for each slot level above 1st.
