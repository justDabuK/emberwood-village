*When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.*

You weave an impossible sign from an inscrutable reality in the air in- side a 30-foot cube within range. It appears for only a moment before vanishing. Each creature in the area who sees the sign must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature becomes blinded and stunned for the spellâ€™s duration. On a successful saving throw, a creature is blinded until the end of your next turn.

The spell ends for a stunned creature if it takes any damage, or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor. When the spell ends for a stunned creature, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.
