You create an orb of acid gel and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage. Whether the attack hits or misses, the orb explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the exploding acid damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
