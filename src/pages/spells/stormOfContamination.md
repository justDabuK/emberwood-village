*When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.*

You create an arcing bolt of eldritch lightning that strikes a target of your choice that you can see within range. Multiple bolts then leap from that target to up to five other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.

A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d12 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a target which fails the saving throw gains 1 Contamination Level.
