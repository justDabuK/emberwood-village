You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
