*When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.*

You call forth a contaminated elemental (*Delirium Elemental*) to do your bidding. Choose air, earth, fire, or water. Eldritch energy conjures a contaminated elemental of the chosen type, which appears in an unoccupied space within range: either an animated sludge (water), entropic flame (fire), living haze (air), or walking geode (earth). Each uses the summoned delerium elemental stat block below, but gains different traits based on the chosen element used to conjure the elemental. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration of the spell. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys any verbal command you give it (no action required by you). If you don’t give any commands, it attacks the closest hostile creature it can see, moving towards it by the most direct route.

The elemental doesn’t disappear if you lose concentration on this spell. Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it attacks you.

An uncontrolled elemental can’t be dismissed by you, and it remains until it is destroyed.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell’s level appears in the stat block.
