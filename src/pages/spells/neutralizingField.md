You negate contaminated magical energies in a 10-foot radius sphere. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centred on you. Creatures in the sphere (including you) can’t gain contamination levels and have immunity to necrotic damage. Contaminated spells can’t be cast by creatures in the area.

**Available for**: bard, cleric, druid, paladin, ranger, sorcerer, warlock, wizard, apothecary

**Discovering the Spell**: A character who can cast 5th level spells, knows the purge contamination spell, and has created at least 1 dose of aqua expurgo may research neutralizing field.
