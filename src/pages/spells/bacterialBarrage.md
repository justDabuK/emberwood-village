You attack a creature in range with a quick spreading infection that takes advantage of existing conditions. Make a ranged spell attack against a target, on a hit the infection does 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. If the target is suffering from the poisoned condition or a disease, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).
