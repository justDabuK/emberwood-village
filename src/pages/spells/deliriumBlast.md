When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination.
You ignite arcane energies stored inside a delerium fragment held in your hand, and hurl it towards a space you can see within range. It explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere of erratic psychic energy that overwhelms the minds and senses of those within. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 psychic damage and becomes incapacitated until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spellâ€™s other effects.

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot
level above 4th.

**Available for**: bard, sorcerer, warlock, wizard, apothecary
