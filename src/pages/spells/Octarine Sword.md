*When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.*

You create a sword-shaped plane of contaminated energy that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the sword.  
On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an additional 4d6 necrotic damage and gains 1 Contamination Level.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d10 and the necrotic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
