_When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level._

You call down eldritch falling stars that crash into the earth at four points you can see within range. Each creature within a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 10d6 radiant damage, 10d6 necrotic damage, 10d6 thunder damage, 10d6 psychic damage, and 10d6 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one burst is affected only once.

The falling stars leave lasting contamination in the areas they affect, which lasts for one hour. A creature that starts its turn within the affected area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 5d6 necrotic damage and gains 1 Contamination Level. It takes half as much damage and does not gain any Contamination Levels on a successful save. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage immediately undergoes a Monstrous Transformation as if they had gained 6 Contamination Levels.

The spell damages structures and objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.
