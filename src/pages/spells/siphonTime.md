*When you cast this spell, you gain 1 Contamination Level.*

You seize upon the flow of time around up to three creatures of your choice within range, drawing seconds from them to use them yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target canâ€™t take reactions. On its turn, it must choose to either move, take an action, or a bonus action: a target can do only one of the three.

A creature affected by this spell can spend its action to try to pull back the threads of time. If it does, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.
While at least one other creature is affected by this spell, you gain an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. If you use this action to cast a spell, that spell must be a cantrip with a casting time of one action.
