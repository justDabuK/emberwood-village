Make a ranged spell attack against a creature you can see in range. If you hit, you wrack the creature with a deadly toxin that causes their eyes to bleed. The creature takes 2d6 necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot above 2nd.
