Choose a creature you can see within range to inflict with a magical poison. The target takes 2d4 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it becomes poisoned for the spellâ€™s duration.

While poisoned in this way, the target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. It takes 2d4 poison damage on a failed saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on that target.

A *lesser restoration* spell cast on the target ends this spell early.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
